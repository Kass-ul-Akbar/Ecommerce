    <h1>Browse Chrome as s guest</h1>
    <p>Important:  Only log into sensitive websites on devices of people that you trust. Owners may be able to gain access to your data.

        In Guest mode, you won't see or change any other Chrome profile's info. When you exit Guest mode, your browsing activity is deleted from the computer.
        
        Use Guest mode for:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Letting others borrow your
                 computer, or borrowing someone else
                  computer.</li>
                  <br>
            <li>Using a public computer, like one at a library or cafe.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to browse privately
             on your own computer,
              use Incognito mode.
               You'll see your info and settings 
               without saving any browsing history.</p>
               <br>
               <br>

               <h1>Others can see some information</h1>
               <br>
               
               
               <p>Guest mode stops Chrome from saving 
                your browsing activity to your local 
                history, but you should only log into 
                sensitive websites on devices of people 
                that you trust. Device owners may be able
                 to gain access to your data, such as your
                  activity and location. This data may also
                   still be visible to:</p>
                   <br>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Websites you visit, including the ads and resources used on those sites</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Websites you sign in to</li>
